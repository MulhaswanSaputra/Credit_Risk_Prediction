# Credit_Risk_Prediction
Virtual internship with id/x partner - Data Science by Rakamin Academy
After 4 weeks following the virtual internship of id/x partner - Data Science from Rakamin Academy, I learned a lot of fundamentals from data science from scratch. Starting from business understanding to model evaluation. The material is dense and concise, making it easier for us to understand basic concepts quickly. They give us assignments every week to test our knowledge. And get direct guidance with a qualified mentor

At the end of the internship, we were tasked with creating an end-to-end solution to analyze and predict credit loans from peer-to-peer lending services. You can see my solution below.
